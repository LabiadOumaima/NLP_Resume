# NLP_Resume
The objective of this project is automatizing the selection of the best candidates.We started by extracting the text from the CVs, then cleaning it from unuseful insights (names,locations,numbers,mails...). Then we calculate the TF-IDF scoring of unigrams/bigrams of key skills and get the decsending ranking of CVs based on their TF-IDF scores.
